# Bootstrap's Modal as a mail form - with Ajax

This is an example of a modal email-form in Bootstrap.

  - It uses javascript for a quick client-side validation and php for server-side validation
  - Uses AJAX to POST
  - There is visual feedback
  - A simple antispam check
  - The form returns a success message
  - It does not need page refresh
  - It resets itself everytime the user sents a message or closes the modal

I created it for my own website and works fine. Do not forget to setup your email address in the PHP file.

(GitHub pages do not support PHP, so it wont submit the form)
