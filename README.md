# Bootstrap's Modal as a mail form

This is an example of a modal email-form in Bootstrap.

  - It uses javascript for a quick client-side validation and php for server-side validation
  - There is visual feedback
  - A simple antispam check
  - The form returns a success message
  - It does not need page refresh
  - It resets itself everytime the user sents a message or closes the modal

I created it for my own website and works fine. Do not forget to setup your email address in the PHP file.
